# Speed Typing Test



The Speed Typing Test is a web application designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It presents a random quote to the user, who then types it as quickly as possible. The app tracks the time taken to type the quote and provides feedback on the result. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and styled with Bootstrap, this application is both user-friendly and visually appealing.
